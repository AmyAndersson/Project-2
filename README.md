### Proposal: 
Using Environmental data from [CSIRO](https://data.csiro.au/dap/home?execution=e1s1/) to map the location the species and their remaining numbers in each location in relation to conservation zones from ( [Department of Agriculture](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/conservation-management-zones-of-australia) ). The focus will be centred around a map, with zoom in and 'clickability' to interact with the data. Data can be filtered on species type which will change interactive visualisations. 

The requirements of the project are :
